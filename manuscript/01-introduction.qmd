# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Universal access to essential medicines is a fundamental goal of effective healthcare systems, yet ensuring equitable availability continues to be a critical global challenge [@quick2003essential; @world2004annual]. Many countries, particularly in Africa and Asia, face significant barriers to accessing these medications, often due to high costs and inefficient supply chain management [@world2004medicines]. A survey conducted in eight sub-Saharan African countries revealed alarmingly low availability of essential medicines. The average availability of women's priority medicines ranged from just 22% to 40%, while children's medicines were only slightly more accessible, with availability ranging from 28% to 57% [@droti2019poor]. However, drug shortages are not limited to low-income regions; they also occur in developed areas like the United States and Europe, where they disrupt healthcare delivery and compromise the quality of patient care [@fox2003managing; @kaakeh2011impact; @johnson2011drug; @huys2013european; @le2011prevalence].

The consequences of drug shortages extend beyond immediate healthcare delivery, impacting healthcare costs, treatment quality, and patient safety [@alspach2012drug; @kaakeh2011impact; @baumer2004national]. Such shortages can result in treatment delays, suboptimal care due to the unavailability of preferred therapies, increased reliance on costly secondary markets, and serious patient outcomes, including complications, longer hospital stays, and even deaths [@alspach2012drug]. Addressing these challenges requires a resilient pharmaceutical supply chain that can ensure the timely availability of medicines. In this context, accurate demand forecasting becomes critical for effective procurement and inventory management [@subramanian2021effective].

Demand forecasting in pharmaceutical supply chains is a highly complex process, shaped by several factors. These include the quality of available data, the specific position within the supply chain, and external influences such as market trends, regulatory changes, and disruptive events such as pandemics, conflicts, flooding [@schneider2010pharmaceutical; @hyndman2018forecasting]. Recently, major donors  such as Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have invested in data collection technologies in sub-Saharan Africa, recognizing the potential of data to provide valuable insights. This investment is essential and offers significant benefits for improving supply chain delivery. However, much of the data being collected focuses on transactional data, such as consumption, distribution, and sale. Almost all platforms collecting data tend to overlook the critical contextual factors and events that influence these transactions—factors that are just as crucial for accurate forecasting. This presents a major barrier, as understanding the broader context, including administration procedures, local policies, disruptions, conflicts, and so on is vital for building reliable forecasting models. This gap — known as business context and domain knowledge — requires urgent attention in pharmaceutical supply chain forecasting. Without incorporating this knowledge, any forecasting model is unlikely to produce reliable results. We must prioritize collecting and integrating this contextual information to improve the accuracy of demand forecasts in pharmaceutical supply chains. Integrating statistical models with domain knowledge leads to a more accurate and context-aware forecasting process, as evidenced by research that highlights the value of judgmental adjustments to enhance forecast accuracy [@fildes2007against; @taylor2022artificial; @soyiri2013overview]. Domain knowledge enables analysts to incorporate relevant events, such as supply chain disruptions, into the forecasting model. This integration is particularly beneficial in fields like healthcare, where expert insights can align algorithms with real-world applications [@dash2022review].

This study aims to bridge that gap by employing advanced machine learning models combined with domain expertise to address the distinctive characteristics of Ethiopia’s pharmaceutical sector. The challenges in this sector, such as diverse product categories, limited data from service delivery points, communication issues, long lead times, forecast inaccuracies, and complex policies, necessitate tailored forecasting approaches [@bilal2024challenges; @boche2022procurement]. Accurate demand forecasting in Ethiopia is essential for optimizing resource allocation, streamlining supply chain operations, and shaping effective healthcare policies [@rostami2022forecasting].

This research uses distribution data from 33 health commodities, covering the period from December 2017 to July 2022, provided by the Ethiopian Pharmaceutical Supply Service (EPSS), to develop models for six-month-ahead forecasting. Initially, we implement univariate models that rely solely on distribution data. Following this, we conduct exploratory data analysis and engage in interviews with EPSS experts to gather domain knowledge on events influencing distribution patterns. Through these interviews, the experts identified three key factors collectively impacting distribution: stock replenishment period, fiscal calendar, and the seasonal malaria. We then develop forecasting models that incorporate the data gathered through the interview process and compare their performance with univariate models that rely solely on distribution data.

Our primary aims is to assess whether incorporating domain knowledge improves forecast accuracy. Moreover, we also fill a gap in the pharmaceutical demand forecasting literature by not only generating point forecasts but also producing probabilistic forecasting techniques that capture the range of potential outcomes with associated probabilities, offering a more comprehensive view of demand uncertainty than traditional methods. Model performance is evaluated using point accuracy measure including MASE, RMSSE, and probabilistic measure using CRPS.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature and identifies gaps to position our work; Section 3 outlines the experimental design, including data sources, forecasting methods, and evaluation criteria; Section 4 presents the results and analysis; and Section 5 concludes with a summary of findings and future research directions.
