### Dataset

For this study, we utilized a dataset spanning five years (2018-2022) of sales data obtained from EPSS. Rigorous checks were conducted to ensure the consistency and completeness of the collected data. From the extensive pool of pharmaceutical products within EPSS, we strategically selected a set of 33 key pharmaceuticals, encompassing various programs and representing different classes of drugs. This deliberate selection enriches the research by providing a comprehensive representation across the pharmaceutical landscape.
We are presenting the graph for some of the pharmaceuticals sales for the last five years by using visualization for the readers to undesrtand the sales of the pharmaceuticals.

# How the domain knowledge were collected (Key informant interview) 

To gather domain knowledge, we contacted experts from the Ethiopian Pharmaceuticals Supply Service (EPSS) who work in the distribution unit. Five experts with over 10 years of experience in managing the distribution of the pharmaceuticals in EPSS agreed to participate. The researchers, along with these experts, examined the electronic bin cards of selected pharmaceuticals. A bin card is a physical or electronic record used to track the inventory levels of individual items in a storage location, such as a warehouse or stockroom. The term 'bin' refers to the specific storage location for an item. Information typically recorded on a bin card includes the Item ID, unit of measure, product description, account details, date, references, beginning balance, manufacturer, batch number, expiry date, quantity received, quantity issued, and balance. In summary, a bin card is a fundamental tool in inventory management, especially in environments where physical stock tracking is essential. It provides a straightforward and immediate way to monitor item quantities, helping to ensure effective inventory management.


We meticulously traced sales data for the past five years, triangulating graphs with bin card records to identify predictors influencing demand for each product. The expert uses their domain knowledge and experience to identify about the distribution charachterstics of the specific products and sometimes when they assume that they do not have enough history or do not remember about that specific products they call to other experts who remember specific issues and decide whetrere the specific predictos affect the distribution and if all of them agree the include it as predcitors. The data collection process took more than a month. We downloaded and analyzed over 100 bin cards per product. Dates on the bin cards were converted from the Ethiopian calendar to the Gregorian calendar for accuracy. Transactions due to storage or warehouse changes within EPSS were excluded. After cleaning the data,and discussing with the experts  we identified the following key predictors affecting distribution and sales: stock replenishment, stock outs, COVID-19, fiscal year counting, conflict, and malaria seasonality.


•	Stock replenishment:  refers to the process of restocking or refilling inventory to ensure that there are sufficient quantities of products or materials available to meet demand. Whenever there was stock replenishment at the central EPSS, sales and distribution to hubs and health facilities increased. This increase was attributed to the need to restock depleted inventories and the push from central EPSS to manage space constraints. 
•	Stockouts:  occur when an inventory item is completely depleted, meaning there is no available stock to meet demand. This can happen when demand exceeds the available supply, or when there is a delay or failure in the replenishment process. Resulted in no transactions and a decline in sales. 

•	COVID-19: COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, had a profound impact on Ethiopia's pharmaceutical supply chain. The pandemic disrupted global manufacturing and supply, leading to shortages of essential medicines and raw materials, Ethiopia, like many other countries, relies heavily on imported pharmaceutical products. With the pandemic causing lockdowns and restrictions in manufacturing hubs like India and China, the supply of essential medicines and raw materials to Ethiopia was significantly disrupted. The impact of COVID-19 on sales was significant. After the announcement of COVID-19 in Ethiopia, the central EPSS pushed a six-month supply of products to hubs to prevent stock outs. This push was from March to August 2020. During this period, if products were not stocked out, sales continued to hubs and health facilities.

•	Physical inventory: refers to the process of manually counting and verifying the actual quantities of pharmaceutical products available in stock at a specific location. The process is critical for maintaining the accuracy of inventory records, ensuring that medicines are available when needed, and preventing stockouts or overstocking.  Physical inventory counting periods also influenced sales. Stores closed during these periods, halting transactions. We observed increased sales before inventory counting periods, as hubs and facilities stocked up. July and August were identified as physical counting periods each year.

•	Internal displacement: Occurs when people are forced to flee their homes but remain within their country's borders, typically due to conflicts, violence, or natural disasters. Conflicts, whether ethnic, political, or resource-driven, can lead to widespread instability, forcing large populations to move and creating humanitarian crises. Conflicts often lead to the destruction of infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and warehouses, making it difficult to transport pharmaceutical products to affected areas. This disruption can cause significant delays or prevent the delivery of essential medicines altogether. Internal displacements and conflicts in Ethiopia over the past five years also affected sales and distribution. We traced periods of instability and included them as predictors. The identified conflict periods were September 2017 to March 2018, February 2019 to June 2019, and November 2020 to July 2022. 

•	Malaria seasonality: Refers to the predictable patterns and fluctuations in malaria incidence throughout the year, typically influenced by climate and environmental conditions. In many regions, malaria transmission peaks during and shortly after the rainy season, when conditions such as stagnant water pools create ideal breeding sites for the Anopheles mosquitoes that transmit the disease. Conversely, malaria cases often decline during the dry season when mosquito breeding sites are reduced. During peak malaria seasons, there is a significant surge in the demand for antimalarial drugs and other related treatments. Malaria seasonality was another significant predictor. Certain pharmaceuticals, like Artemether + Lumefanthrine and Rapid Diagnostic Test kits, were affected by malaria outbreaks. We identified epidemic periods affecting sales: September to December 2017, March to May 2018, September to December 2018, March to May 2019, September to December 2019, March to May 2020, September to December 2020, March to May 2021, September to December 2021, and March to May 2022.
